## In Ears at Home

Playing around with audio and timing in the style of an IEM system (In-Ear Monitors)

I don't plan to continue this or take it anywhere, just a fun experiment I might come back to sometimes.

Todos: 
- Vocal track doesn't line up with the rest of the stems
- Metronome feels off, but unsure
- See if there's a way to retrieve and stem a song programmatically
